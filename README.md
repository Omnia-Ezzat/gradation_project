 Weather Prediction and Machine Learning Automation Web App
Overview
This project is a part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative, developed in collaboration with EYouth. It consists of two main components:

Weather Prediction System
Machine Learning Automation Web App
Both components aim to simplify complex data science tasks, providing easy-to-use solutions for weather prediction and automating machine learning workflows.

1. Weather Prediction System
This part of the project involves a Streamlit-based dashboard that provides in-depth insights into weather data, allowing users to explore historical weather patterns and make predictions about future weather conditions.

Features:
Visualize historical weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity, etc.)
Identify weather trends and patterns over time.
Make real-time weather predictions using machine learning models.

2. Machine Learning Automation Web App
This tool simplifies the process of working with machine learning models by automating several key steps in the workflow, making it accessible even to users with no coding experience.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Automatically handles missing values, normalization, and encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Automatically generates charts and insights for better data understanding.
Data Visualization: Interactive graphs and plots for insightful analysis.
Model Prediction: Upload datasets, select a machine learning model, and get predictions without writing a single line of code.
